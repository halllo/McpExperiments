# MCP Experiments

These MCP experiments are based on Laurent Kemp√©'s [tutorial](https://laurentkempe.com/2025/03/22/model-context-protocol-made-easy-building-an-mcp-server-in-csharp/).

There is a dotnet MCP server over stdio that provides a function to return the current time.

There is a dotnet MCP client that makes it available to a local LLM which invokes it.

It uses the official [mcp-csharp-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk).

## Develop

Build all MCP projects:

```powershell
dotnet build
```

Start the MCP server over SSE and streamable HTTP:

```powershell
dotnet run --project MyMCPServer.Sse --launch-profile https
```

## Claude Desktop

To add it to [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), change the `claude_desktop_config.json` like this:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "getTime": {
            "command": "D:\\McpExperiments\\MyMCPServer.Stdio\\bin\\Debug\\net9.0\\MyMCPServer.Stdio.exe"
        },
        "getVibe": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "mcp-remote@0.0.9",
                "http://localhost:5253/sse"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Claude Desktop seems to not yet natively support SSE transport.

## Authorization

Web-based MCP servers using SSE or streamable HTTP should require authorization.

Microsoft [plans to implement all specified authentication protocols described in the MCP spec](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-partners-with-anthropic-to-create-official-c-sdk-for-model-context-protocol?commentid=47#comment-47), but there is no roadmap yet.

In this repository I am experimenting with differnt kinds of authentication and authorization for MCP servers. To test it, we can use the _mcp inspector_ and the browser developer tools.

```powershell
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

### MCP server as Identity Provider

~~According to the first [specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/) the MCP server should also be an OAuth authorization server. To experiment with that, I built a light-weight OAuth server base on <https://youtu.be/EBVKlm0wyTE>.~~

### MCP server as Resource Provider

According to the current [specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization) the MCP server should provide _Protected Resource Metadata_ to point to an OAuth server's _Authorization Service Metadata_. That AS should implement _Dynamic Client Registration_.

We use [Duende Identity Server](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver) to build a centralized Authorization Server. Unfortunately Duende does not yet support MCP in combination with `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector`. So I had to apply a few adjustments to my [experimental instance of Duende](https://github.com/halllo/PermissionedNotes/tree/main/IdentityServer).

- provide the OIDC discovery document also at `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- the discovery document needs to also include the `registration_endpoint` endpoint for DCR
- MCP inspector does not register clients with any scopes, so we add all scopes to the newly registered clients
- MCP inspector does not follow redirects of DCR endpoint, so we cannot use frontchannel authorization
- MCP inspector does not provide scopes during the `/authorize` request (just the resource indicator), so we inject all scopes of the resource to bypass Duende's `missing scope` validation

As next steps I need to look into MCP inspector to better understand if it could

- pass scopes during DCR and `/authorize`
- follow redirects and deal with DCR requiring authorization
